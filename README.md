# Duoload

Duoload is an utility to transfer a user's vocabulary data from the [Duocards](https://duocards.com/)
into the Anki flashcards local database.

This application is intended to be used only with user-created cards. Please, respect copyright and
don't download third party Duocards card stacks.

## Vibe coding

This utility was vibe coded using:

* Gemini 2.5 Pro
* Cloudie 4.0 sonnet
* Cursor using 'auto' mode

It also got some manual polishing (mostly in specs, PRDs and tests) and was completely reviewed by humans.

It also was tested to work with Duocards as per Jule 2025 with a personal database of 2k+ words.
